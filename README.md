# TDOOS Redesign

This is a JavaScript project to redesign [The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/). I plan to use a web scraper to retrieve the content, and redesign the front-end as a single page application using React.

Written using the help of this webscraper tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js
